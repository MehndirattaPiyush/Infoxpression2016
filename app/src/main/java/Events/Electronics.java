It will cover designs from basic logical circuits to hardcore electrical circuits; their rectification and building of the correct circuit. It will comprise of different levels, including both hardware and software aspects, with increasing difficulty levels.", 
	"This event is a hurdle race designed for robots. Teams will compete against each other while racing their robots on a track with hurdles. The winning team will be the one whose robot crosses the hurdles and finishes the race in minimum time. Penalty time will be added to the total time in case a hurdle is skipped or the robot touches the boundary.",
